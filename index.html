            <h3 class="section-title">Who was Muhammad Ali ?</h3>
            <p class="info">
                Muhammad Ali (1942-2016) was an American former heavyweight champion boxer and one of the
                greatest sporting figures of the 20th century.
                An Olympic gold medalist and the first fighter to capture the heavyweight title three times, Ali
                won 56 times in his 21-year professional career.
                Ali’s outspokenness on issues of race, religion and politics made him a controversial figure
                during his career, and the heavyweight’s quips and taunts were as quick as his fists.

            <h3 class="section-title">Muhammad Ali’s Early Years and Amateur Career</h3>
            <p class="info">
                Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., the elder son of Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr. (1912-1990) and Odessa
                Grady Clay (1917-1994), was born on January, 17, 1942,
                in Louisville, Kentucky. It was a red-and-white Schwinn that steered the future heavyweight
                champion to the sport of boxing.
                When his beloved bicycle was stolen, a tearful 12-year-old Clay reported the theft to Louisville
                police officer Joe Martin (1916-1996) and vowed to pummel the culprit.
                Martin, who was also a boxing trainer, suggested that the upset youngster first learn how to
                fight, and he took Clay under his wing.
                Six weeks later, Clay won his first bout in a split decision.

            <h3 class="section-title">Muhammad Ali: Heavyweight Champion of the World</h3>
            <p class="info">
                After winning his first 19 fights, including 15 knockouts, Clay received his first title shot on
                February 25, 1964, against reigning heavyweight champion Sonny Liston (1932-1970). Although he
                arrived in Miami Beach, Florida, a 7-1 underdog, the 22-year-old Clay relentlessly taunted
                Liston before the fight, promising to “float like a butterfly, sting like a bee” and predicting
                a knockout. When Liston failed to answer the bell at the start of the seventh round, Clay was
                indeed crowned heavyweight champion of the world. In the ring after the fight, the new champ
                roared, “I am the greatest!”<br><br>

                At a press conference the next morning, Clay, who had been seen around Miami with controversial
                Nation of Islam member Malcolm X (1925-1965), confirmed the rumors of his conversion to Islam.
                On March 6, 1964, Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad (1897-1975) bestowed on Clay the name
                of Muhammad Ali. <br><br>

                Ali solidified his hold on the heavyweight championship by knocking out Liston in the first
                round of their rematch on May 25, 1965, and he defended his title eight more times. Then, with
                the Vietnam War raging, Ali showed up for his scheduled induction into the U.S. Armed Forces on
                April 28, 1967. Citing his religious beliefs, he refused to serve. Ali was arrested, and the New
                York State Athletic Commission immediately suspended his boxing license and revoked his
                heavyweight belt. <br><br>

                Convicted of draft evasion, Ali was sentenced to the maximum of five years in prison and a
                $10,000 fine, but he remained free while the conviction was appealed. Many saw Ali as a draft
                dodger, and his popularity plummeted. Banned from boxing for three years, Ali spoke out against
                the Vietnam War on college campuses. As public attitudes turned against the war, support for Ali
                grew. In 1970 the New York State Supreme Court ordered his boxing license reinstated, and the
                following year the U.S. Supreme Court overturned his conviction in a unanimous decision.

            <h3 class="section-title">Muhammad Ali’s Later Years and Legacy</h3>
                <p class="info">
                    In 1984 Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson’s syndrome, possibly connected to the severe head
                    trauma suffered during his boxing career. The former champion’s motor skills slowly
                    declined,
                    and his movement and speech were limited. In spite of the Parkinson’s, Ali remained in the
                    public spotlight, traveling the world to make humanitarian, goodwill and charitable
                    appearances.
                    He met with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein (1937-2006) in 1990 to negotiate the release of
                    American
                    hostages, and in 2002 he traveled to Afghanistan as a United Nations Messenger of Peace.
                    <br><br>

                    Ali had the honor of lighting the cauldron during the opening ceremonies of the 1996 Summer
                    Olympics in Atlanta. In 1999 Ali was voted the BBC’s “Sporting Personality of the Century,”
                    and
                    Sports Illustrated named him “Sportsman of the Century.” Ali was awarded the Presidential
                    Medal
                    of Freedom in a 2005 White House ceremony, and in the same year the $60 million Muhammad Ali
                    Center, a nonprofit museum and cultural center focusing on peace and social responsibility,
                    opened in Louisville. <br><br>

                    Ring Magazine named Ali “Fighter of the Year” five times, more than any other boxer, and he
                    was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990. Ali has been married four
                    times
                    and has seven daughters and two sons. He married his fourth wife, Yolanda, in 1986. Ali died
                    at
                    the age of 74 on June 3, 2016.
